\section{ePape - Effective Sound Speed Pad\'e Parabolic Equation Code}
\label{sec: ePape}

{\bf ePape} implements a "Parabolic Equation" (PE)\cite{collins2019parabolic} one-way algorithm, originally developed for ocean acoustic applications, with the influence of the winds approximated using the effective sound speed approximation. As such, propagation is restricted to a single range/altitude plane specified by an azimuth. The influence of cross winds is not modeled. The functions of differential operators that arise are approximated using a Pad\'e expansion whose order can be specified. The differential operators are discretized using a finite difference scheme. The Pad\'e approximation provides numerical accuracy at high elevation angles; however, this can not be considered a high angle PE because the effective sound speed approximation limits the elevation angle, as well as the allowable wind speeds. Attenuation by the atmosphere is implemented via the addition of an imaginary part to the wave number. Both stratified and range dependent atmospheres are supported. Ground impedance boundary conditions are also supported; however, no impedance models have been included yet. With this release, propagation over flat ground has been implemented and tested. Inclusion of ground topography is not supported in this release.

\subsection{Mathematical Background}
The PE algorithms operate in the frequency domain and are thus approximate solutions to the convective Helmholtz equation. It's natural to work in cylindrical coordinates range $r$, azimuth $\theta$, and altitude $z$. {\bf ePape} uses the effective sound speed approximation\cite{waxler2019propagation} in which the thermodynamic sound speed, $c$, is replace by $c_{\text{eff}}(\theta,z)=c(z)+u(\theta,z)$, where $u$ is the horizontal component of the wind along a given azimuth $\theta$. In this approximation the influence of cross winds is not modeled, causing the propagation to be restricted to a single range/altitude plane, an $r-z$ plane. The plane is fixed by setting an azimuth, $\theta$. In the effective sound speed approximation, the solution depends on azimuth only through the effective sound speed. Similarly, the locally stratified approximation is used, in which $c$ and $u$ can depend on range $r$, but the $r$ dependence is very slowly varying on the scale of acoustic wavelengths so that changes in $c$ and $u$ can be treated by using the value of $c_{\text{eff}}$ at the range step being considered, ignoring the $r$ dependence, which is to say derivatives with respect to $r$, of $c_{\text{eff}}$ at each range step. 


Introduce the effective wave number (we will drop the explicit dependence on azimuth) 
\[
k(z)=\frac{\omega}{c_{\text{eff}}(z)}.
\]
If $P(r,z)$ is the acoustic pressure, then 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eff_snd_helmholtz}
\Big(
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}
+
\rho_0(z)\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\frac{1}{\rho_0(z)}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}
+
k(z)^2
\Big)P(r,z)=0
\end{equation}
where $\rho_0$ is the mean atmospheric density. The acoustic pressure $P$ is scaled by both the $r^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ geometrical spreading factor and the $\sqrt{\rho_0}$ density factor, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:scaled_P}
P(r,z)=\sqrt{\frac{\rho_0(z)}{r}}\tilde P(r,z).
\end{equation}
Let $k_0$ be a reference wave number, typically the wave number on the ground, and introduce the far field altitude operator 
\[
Q=\frac{1}{k_0^2}\Big(\frac{d^2}{d z^2}+\tilde k(z)^2-k_0^2\Big),
\]
with 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wavenumber}
k(z)=\sqrt{k(z)^2-\frac{3}{4}\frac{\rho_0^\prime(z)}{\rho_0(z)}+\frac{\rho_0^{\prime\prime}(z)}{\rho_0(z)}}.
\end{equation}
Then, in the far field, ignoring terms of order $\frac{1}{r^2}$, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eff_snd_range_scaled}
\Big(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}+k_0^2(1+Q)\Big)\tilde P(r,z)=0.
\end{equation}
Formally factoring the differential operator
\[
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r^2}+k_0^2(1+Q)
=
\Big(\frac{\partial}{\partial r}+ik_0\sqrt{1+Q}\Big)\Big(\frac{\partial}{\partial r}-ik_0\sqrt{1+Q}\Big)
\]
we see that solutions of 
\[
\Big(\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\pm ik_0\sqrt{1+Q}\Big) \tilde P(r,z)=0
\]
are one way solutions of Eq.\,\ref{eq:eff_snd_range_scaled} in the sense that they represent waves traveling in a single direction, ie. outward in the $-$ case and inward in the $+$ case. We will restrict to the outward going case. 

Dividing out a carrier wave as well,
\[
P =\frac{1}{\sqrt{r}} \tilde P =\frac{e^{ik_0r}}{\sqrt{r}} p,
\]
one finds that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:parabolic}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}=ik_0\big(\sqrt{1+Q}-1\big)p. 
\end{equation}
Here $p$ is thought of as a vector valued function of $r$ indexed by the altitude $z$. Note that Eq.\,\ref{eq:parabolic} is the origin of the name ``Parabolic Equation Method''. In the earliest application of this approach $\sqrt{1+Q}-1$ was approximated by $\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial z^2}$, resulting in a parabolic equation. 

Eq. \ref{eq:parabolic} has a formal solution, 
\[
p(r)=e^{ik_0(\sqrt{1+Q}-1)(r-r_0)} p(r_0)
\]
where $r_0<r$. One thinks of $p(r)$ as having been propagated out in range from $r_0$ to $r$. The PE algorithm is based on the formula (Trotter product formula \cite{stoer2013introduction} 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:trotter_prod}
p(r)=\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\Big(e^{ik_0(\sqrt{1+Q}-1)\frac{r-r_0}{N}}\Big)^N p(r_0)
\end{equation}
so that letting 
\[
\Delta r=\frac{r-r_0}{N}
\]
and q

\[
r_j=r_0+j\Delta r
\]
one has the approximation 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:split_step}
p(r_j)=e^{i\delta(\sqrt{1+Q}-1)}p(r_{j-1})
\end{equation}
with $\delta=k_0\Delta r$. This allows us to march out from $r_0$ to $r$ if an efficient approximation for $e^{i\delta(\sqrt{1+Q}-1)}$ can be found. The atmospheric profile can be changed as required. Generally, $r_0$ is some small reference range and the starting pressure field, $p_0=p(r_0)$, is called the starter. The starter is usually chosen in such a way as to mimic the signal at range $r_0$ from a point source. In this release, a point source started has been implemented. 

At high enough frequencies the ground can be treated as an impedance plane. This approximation ignores any signal propagation in the substrata and is implemented by imposing the boundary condition 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:impedance}
\frac{\partial P(r,z)}{\partial z}\big|_{z=0}=-\frac{i\omega\rho_0(0)}{Z(\omega)}P(r,0)
\end{equation}
where $Z(\omega)$ is the effective ground impedance. This boundary condition influences the operator $Q$. Note that the density scaling effects the boundary condition. One finds that 
\[
\frac{\partial \tilde P(r,z)}{\partial z}\big|_{z=0}
=
-\Big(\frac{i\omega\rho_0(0)}{Z(\omega)}+\frac{\rho_0^\prime(0)}{2\rho_0(0)}\Big)P(r,0).
\]
The additional density dependent terms provide the Lamb wave but are of the same order as the additional density dependent terms in $\tilde k$ and are usually ignored for frequencies above about 0.08 Hz where buoyancy is not significant. 

The ground impedance is to be considered user input, similarly to the atmospheric profiles. It is generally a complex number. As $Z(\omega)\rightarrow \infty$ this becomes the rigid ground condition. This is expected as $\omega\rightarrow 0$. In common practice the ground impedance is set to zero for purposes of infrasound modeling, however, the low frequency behavior of the ground interaction is not well understood. 

To implement Eq.\ref{eq:split_step}, regardless of $Q$, an effective approximation must be found for the action of the operator 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:propagator}
{\cal F}(\delta,Q)=e^{i\delta(\sqrt{1+Q}-1)}
\end{equation}
on functions of altitude. To this end a Pad\'e approximant will be used. The Pad\'e approximant is a best fit rational function of a given order. To approximate ${\cal F}(\delta,x)$, one defines 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pade}
R(x)=\frac{a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\dots+a_nx^n}{1+b_1x+b_2x^2+\dots+b_mx^m}
\end{equation}
and then chooses the coefficients $a_j$ and $b_k$ so that the Taylor expansions of $R$ and ${\cal F}$ coincide up to order $N=n+m$. Explicitly, 
\[
\frac{d^j R}{dx^j}\big|_{x=0}=\frac{d^j {\cal F}}{dx^j}\big|_{x=0}
\]
for $j=0,1,\dots,N$. That gives $N+1$ equations for as many unknown coefficients. If one restricts $m\ge n$ then $R(x)$ remains bounded for large $x$. One then approximates 
\[
{\cal F}(\delta,x)\approx R(x). 
\]
Approximation by a rational function is preferable to approximation by a polynomial, {\it ie} by a Taylor expansion, because polynomials always increase without bound for large argument. If we insist, as we will, that $m\ge n$ then the approximating function, $R(x)$, is bounded. 

To determine the coefficients $a_j$ and $b_j$ we will need the Taylor coefficients, $c_j$, of ${\cal F}$, 
\[
{\cal F}(\delta,\xi)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(\delta) \xi^n
\]
Thompson\cite{roberts2013numerically} has derived a recursion relation for the expansion coefficients $c_n$, 
\[
c_{n+1}=-\frac{2n-1}{2(n+1)}c_n-\frac{\delta^2}{4n(n+1)}c_{n-1}. 
\]
This makes the computation of the expansion coefficients very efficient. Note that $c_0=1$ and $c_1=i\frac{\delta}{2}$. Then the $a_j$ and $b_j$ are determined by the condition that that the Taylor expansion of the function 
\[
{\cal F}(\delta,x)-R(x)
=
\sum_{j=0}^\infty c_j(\delta) x^j-\frac{\sum_{l=0}^n a_lx^l}{1+\sum_{k=1}^m b_kx^k}
\]
begin at order $x^{m+n+1}$. This is equivalent to the coefficients in the power series 
\[
\big(\sum_{j=0}^\infty c_j(\delta) x^j\big)\big(1+\sum_{k=1}^m b_kx^k\big)
-
\sum_{l=0}^n a_lx^l
\]
be zero for powers less than or equal to $m+n$. This recursion leads to a sequence of equations. At index $0$,  
\[
a_0=c_0,
\]
for $i=1,2,\dots,n$, 
\[
\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}c_jb_{i-j}-a_i=-c_i, 
\]
for $i=n+1,n+2,\dots,m$, 
\[
\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}c_jb_{i-j}=-c_i,
\]
and, for $i=m+1,m+2,\dots,N$, 
\[
\sum_{j=i-m}^{i-1}c_jb_{i-j}=-c_i. 
\]
Since the $c_i$ are known, this gives a system of linear equations for the coefficients $a_j$ and $b_j$. This linear system can be readily solved for the coefficients $a_j$ and $b_j$. The approximation for Eq.\,\ref{eq:propagator} is given by 
\[
R(Q)=\frac{a_0+a_1Q+a_2Q^2+\dots+a_nQ^n}{1+b_1Q+b_2Q^2+\dots+b_mQ^m}.
\]
In {\bf ePape} $m$ is fixed at $n+1$. The user is given an option to choose $m$.  

Atmospheric attenuation is taken into account by adding an imaginary part, $\alpha_{\text{att}}$, known as the attenuation coefficient, to the wave number $k$. Standard models for the attenuation coefficient are to be found in the literature and generally attributed to Sutherland and Bass\cite{bass_suth}. An extension of the Sutherland-Bass model due to Godin takes into account the influence of the winds and can be used as well\cite{Godin_attenuation}. 

An artificial attenuation layer is introduced at the top of the computational domain to prevent spurious reflections. The absorbing layer comprises an additional imaginary part $\alpha_A(z)$ of $k(z)$ where $\alpha_A$ is zero for $z$ less than some fixed altitude, $z_T$, but increases above that altitude slowly enough that there are no significant signal returns from the layer, but becomes large enough to attenuate all signals. The form used in {\bf ePape} is 
\[
\alpha_A(z)=\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } z<z_T\\
\mu e^{\frac{z-z_t}{m\lambda}} & \text{if } z>z_T
\end{cases}
\]
Rather than introducing a new symbol we will define  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:complex_k}
k(z)
=
\sqrt{\frac{\omega^2}{c_{\text{eff}}(z)^2}-\frac{3}{4}\frac{\rho_0^\prime(z)}{\rho_0(z)}+\frac{\rho_0^{\prime\prime}(z)}{\rho_0(z)}}
+i\alpha_{\text{att}}(z)+i\alpha_A(z)
\end{equation}

To evaluate the action of $Q^n$ on vertical vectors $p$ the $z$ axis is replaced with a uniform grid with spacing $h$ and then, writing
\[
p_j=p(jh)
\] 
we replace $\frac{d^2}{dz^2}$ with the centered finite difference operator, 
\[
\frac{d^2p}{dz^2}\big|_{z=jh}\approx \frac{p_{j+1}-2p_j+p_{j-1}}{h^2}
\]
leading to the tri-diagonal matrix
\[
\Big(\frac{d^2}{dz^2}\Big)_{j,k}\approx \frac{\delta_{j,k+1}-2\delta_{j,k}+\delta_{j,k-1}}{h^2};
\]

This form is fine for $j>1$. For $j=1$ the boundary condition Eq. \ref{eq:impedance} must be implemented. Write it in the form 
\[
\frac{\partial \tilde P(r,z)}{\partial z}\big|_{z=0}=-{\cal A}P(r,0)
\]
and implement it to first order by introducing a $j=0$ term such that 
\[
\frac{p_1-p_0}{h}\approx -{\cal A}p_1
\]
from which it follows that $p_0=(1+h{\cal A})p_1$ and then 
\[
\frac{p_{2}-2p_1+p_0}{h^2}\approx \frac{p_{2}-(1-h{\cal A})p_1}{h^2}.
\]
Thus, the centered finite difference version of $\frac{d^2}{dz^2}$ incorporating the impedance boundary condition is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Discrete_d^2}
D=
\frac{1}{h^2}\begin{pmatrix}
-1+h{\cal A}&1& &&&\\
1&-2&1&&&\\
&1&-2&1&&\\
&&\ddots&\ddots&\ddots&\\
&&& 1&-2&1\\
&&& &1&-2
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
If we introduce the diagonal matrix $K$ with matrix elements 
\[
K_{jk}=\delta_{j,k} \Big(k(jh)^2-k_0^2)
\]
then the centered finite difference version of $Q$ is 
\begin{equation} 
Q=\frac{1}{k_0^2}(D+K)
\end{equation}
Note that the rigid ground condition is obtained with ${\cal A}=0$ and the pressure release condition with $p_0=0$ leading to ${\cal A}=-\frac{1}{h}$.

Finally, we have implemented the Collins self-starter\cite{collins1992self,collins1999stabilized}. The Collins self-starter is based on the using the modal expansion for a single step. The modes are the eigenfunctions of $Q$. The modal horizontal wave numbers $k_n$ are given by the solutions of the eigenvalue problem 
\[
k_0^2(1+Q)\phi_n=k_n^2 \phi_n 
\]
and the pressure at range $r$ from a point source at altitude $z_0$ and $r=0$ is approximated using 
\[
\begin{aligned}
p(r,z)&=\sum_n\Big(\frac{2\pi i}{k_n r}\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}} \phi_n(z_0) \phi_n(z) e^{ik_n r}\\
&=\Big(\frac{2\pi i}{k_0 r}\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}} (1+Q)^{-\frac{1}{4}} e^{ik_0 r (1+Q)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \sum_n \phi_n(z_0) \phi_n(z)\\
&=\Big(\frac{2\pi i}{k_0 r}\Big)^{\frac{1}{2}} (1+Q)^{-\frac{1}{4}} e^{ik_0 r (1+Q)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \delta(z-z_0). 
\end{aligned}
\]
To understand how to interpret this for the discretized altitude note that if $z_0=j_0h$ then one has 
\[
\begin{aligned}
f(j_0h)&=\int_0^\infty f(z)\delta(z-j_0h)\, dz \\
&= \sum_{j=1}^N f(jh) \delta{j,j_0} 
\end{aligned}
\]
so that 
\[
\delta(z-j_0h)\approx \frac{1}{h}\delta{j,j_0} .
\]
A Gaussian starter is included in {\bf ePape}, but is not recommended as it imperfectly estimates a point source and introduces error relative to the modal models.

The basic functionality of ePape is to produce single frequency transfer function for signal propagation in the effective sound speed approximation. Explicitly, the long range propagated acoustic pressure amplitude at a single frequency produced by a unit point source at a reference range of 1 km is computed. The density scaled pressure, $\rho_0^{-\frac{1}{2}}P$, is written to files. The magnitude of the transfer function is refereed to as the signal attenuation. To obtain the physical attenuation the output must be multiplied by $\rho_0^{-\frac{1}{2}}$; however, for purposes of visualization this is not advised since the physical acoustic pressure decreases dramatically with increasing altitude, making it difficult to visualize. The attenuation in dB relative to 1 is referred to as the transmission loss. 

\verb+Options Control:+ Parameters and options can be sent to {\bf ePape} either on the command line, or through a parameter file \verb+epade_pe.param+ by setting the option \verb+--paramfile+. The option \verb+--paramfile+ causes the current parameter set to be printed to the screen. 

\verb+Atmosphere:+ The input of atmospheric profiles is currently through ascii files specified using \verb+--atmosfile+ or \verb+--atmosfile2d+. The \verb+--atmosfile+ flag indicates that a stratified model atmosphere is being used, and a single file is specified. The \verb+--atmosfile2d+ flag indicates that a range dependent model atmosphere is being used and is specified through an atmospheric summary file. The summary file has two columns, range and filename; the files contain the atmsopheric specifications that commence at the indicated range. Binary format input is under development.
 
\verb+Modes of Operation:+ Using the \verb+--singleprop+ option the attenuation along a single azimuth is computed. By default, the attenuation along the ground is saved in \verb+tloss_1d.pe+ and the attenuation in the entire range/altitude plane is saved in \verb+tloss_2d.pe+. With the \verb+--multiprop+ option the attenuation along a specified grid of azimuths is computed and stored in \verb+tloss_multiplot.pe+. In \verb+tloss_multiplot.pe+ data is stored in line seperated blocks of constant range. \verb+--multiprop+ uses the functionality of \verb+--singleprop+ for each azimuth. For convenience, the column format in \verb+tloss_1d.pe+ is the same as \verb+tloss_multiplot.pe+ in that the azimuth is saved in the second column. Currently, only stratified atmospheres are supported for \verb+--multiprop+. Support for range dependent atmospheres is under development. 

\verb+Optional Parameters:+ Parameters can be changed from their default values. The \verb+--npade+ flag allows the user to choose the degree of the polynomial in the denomenator of the Pad\'e approximant. The default is 4. Note that the numerator has degree one less than the denominator. The \verb+dz_m+ flag allows the user to choose the altitude resolution. The default is the closest value to 20 points per wavelength, computed on the ground, that respects a uniform grid. The user has control over the numnber of range steps through \verb+--Nrng_steps+. The default range step is one wavelength, estimated using the nomunal sound speed 340 m/s. A ground impedence value can be input using the \verb+--ground_impedence_real+ and \verb+--ground_impedence_imag+ flags. 


\subsection{Running ePape: examples}
\label{sec: pade examples}

The {\bf ePape} help page ends with three examples designed to be run in the \verb+samples+ directory. 

\noindent 1) The first example is propagation a the stratified model atmosphere, the NCPA toy atmosphere, with source on the ground. The command line is 
\begin{verbatim}
    ../bin/ePape --singleprop --atmosfile NCPA_canonical_profile_trimmed.dat \
         --freq 0.1 --azimuth 90 --maxrange_km 1000
\end{verbatim}
and the results are shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig: ePape ex1}. The 1d transmission loss for ground to ground propagation is shown on the left plotted as transmission loss versus range, and the 2d transmission loss in the full range-altitude plane is shown on the right plotted as altitude versus range with transmission loss indicated by color.

Each row contains a range (in km) and a file name. The range indicates where the model atmosphere given in the corresponding file is to commence. In this example, propagation is directly to the east. The model zonal winds and the corresponding effective sound speeds are shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig: ePape ex2 profiles}. In Fig.\,\ref{fig: ePape ex2} the 1d transmission loss for ground to ground propagation is shown on the left plotted as transmission loss versus range, and the 2d transmission loss in the full range-altitude plane is shown on the right plotted as altitude versus range with transmission loss indicated by color.

\noindent 3) The third example shows how to use the \verb+--multiplot+ option for the NCPA toy atmosphere. The command line is
\begin{verbatim}
    ../bin/ePape --multiprop --atmosfile NCPA_canonical_profile_trimmed.dat \
         --freq 0.5 --azimuth_start 0 --azimuth_end 360 --azimuth_step 2 \
         --maxrange_km 1000
\end{verbatim}
The lossless and lossy results are shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig: ePape ex3}.
